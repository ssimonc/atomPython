    "# General principles\n",
    "ATOM is an order-driven financial market model in which artificial trading agents can interact. In particular, it allows to see the consequences of executing series of orders, to test specific traders behaviours or to test market regulation rules. ATOM is based on multi-agent technology, a branch of AI studying the interactions between artificial entities and their interactions. ATOM can manage thousands of agents simultaneously on a multi-option market with a double order book such as Euronext or NYSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loading of the ATOM library is very classically done by an import. It is generally preferable to load different libraries at the same time (notably numpy, random and statsmodels as well as matplotlib for the graphical charts) allowing the analysis of the different data produced."

This property is not verified by the rate of increase: if we limit ourselves to prices drawn between 1000 and 10000, the maximum rate of increase is 9, and the minimum rate of increase is $-0.9$. The distribution of returns defined as the rate of increase will therefore not be symmetrical.\n",
